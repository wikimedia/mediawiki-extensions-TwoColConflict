Feature: Two column edit conflict screen
  Background:
    Given I am logged in
    And I have reset my preferences
    And TwoColConflict is enabled as a beta feature
	And TwoColConflict is using the inline interface

  Scenario: Basic two-column edit conflict page is shown correctly
    When I go to the "TwoColConflict Test Page" page with content "I am a sentence."
    And I click Edit
    And Another user changes content of the "TwoColConflict Test Page" page to "I am a longer sentence than before."
    And I edit the page with "Adding some random content."
    And I save the edit
    Then The two column edit conflict screen should be shown
    And The editor should contain "I am a longer sentence than before."
    And Changes should be shown as split into foreign and own
    And Section for common changes should not be there
    And Own changes section should contain "Adding some random content."
    And Foreign changes section should contain "I am a longer sentence than before."
